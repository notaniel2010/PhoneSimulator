PhoneSimulator
==============
A simualation of how a cell tower works in relation to the distance of the phone from the tower.
The app has 2 phones by default and features a random distance each time for the phone. 
The call can not be completed if the phones are more than a set distance from the tower (either phone can be too far and the call will not be completed)

Again the project was made in java, I am also not familar with github as of now so I am probably putting the 
code in wrong, but if you paste it into bluej or eclipse it should work as long as the classes are named right.
